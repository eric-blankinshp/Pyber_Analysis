# Pyber_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to comb through ride sharing data nd determine key metrics that will allow V. Isualize to compare rural, suburban, and urban cities' rides. This included total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as average fares per ride and per driver. This data was organized to various tables.
